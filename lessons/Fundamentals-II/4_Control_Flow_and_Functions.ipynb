    "**Variables** are names attached to particular values.\n",
    "   * To create a variable, you assign it a value and then start using it.\n",
    "   * Assignment is done with a single equals sign `=`.\n",
    "   * When we write `n = 300`, we are assigning 300 to the variable `n` via the assignment operator `=`.\n",

    "**Statements** are instructions that a Python interpreter can execute.\n",
    "   * They end with a NEWLINE character. This means each line in Python is a statement.\n",

    "   * `print()` `len()`, and `type()`, are some of the most commonly used functions.\n",
    "   * You can identify a function because of its trailing round parentheses.  \n",

    "**Arguments** are the \"things\" we perform the action on within a function.\n",
    "   * They can be variables, datasets, or even other functions!\n",
    "   * Arguments go inside the trailing parentheses of functions when we call them.\n",
    "   * Arguments are also called inputs or parameters.\n",

    "**Methods** are type-specific functions.\n",
    "   * Different data types and structures have functions that only apply to them.\n",
    "   * For instance, strings have methods that only apply to them (lowercasing, uppercasing, etc.) that won't work with other data types.\n",
    "   * Methods are accessed using dot notation ‚Äì e.g. `some_string.lower()`.\n",
