    "**Variables** are names attached to particular objects. To create a variable, you just assign it a value and then start using it. Assignment is done with a single equals sign (=): `n = 300`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statements** are instructions that a Python interpreter can execute. They end with a NEWLINE character. That means each line in Python is a statement. For instance, `print('Hello')` is a statement; `x = 20` is a statement; `print(x)` is a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions** perform actions on things. `print()` is one of the most familiar. You can often identify a function because of its trailing round parentheses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Arguments** are the \"things\" we perform the action on. They can be values, mathematical expressions, text, variables, datasets, or even other functions! Arguments go inside the trailing parentheses of functions when we call them. \n",

    "## Principles of Writing Your Own Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Function writing is one of the most important skills you can develop as a programmer. However, there is also a lot that can go wrong in the function writing process, leading to time-consuming corrections. Here are some guidelines that can help minimize errors and make the process less painful:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Plan**\n",
    "    1. What is the overall goal of the function? Is there a function that exists already that does the same thing? \n",
    "    2. What is going to be the output of the function? (what data type, how many items)?\n",
    "    3. What arguments will you need? What pieces of the function do you need to control?\n",
    "    4. What are the general steps of the program? This can be written in bullet points or \"pseudocode\".\n",
    "2. **Write**\n",
    "    1. Start by writing the code without the function wrapper.\n",
    "    2. Start small. Write small self-contained blocks of code and put the pieces together. You can also consider sub-functions if it is a particularly complex issue.\n",
    "    3. Test each part of the function as it is added. Track the input of the function and how it changes at each step. \n",
    "    4. Wrap the code in the function syntax.\n",
    "3. **Test**\n",
    "    1. Take the function and test *several* cases.\n",
    "    2. Before running test cases, form an expectation of the result. \n",
    "    3. Test the function. Pay attention to both errors and strange results. Make adjustments to account for new cases.\n",
    "    4. Integrate the function with the rest of the code. Are the input arguments the right type? Does the output flow into the rest of the code?"
