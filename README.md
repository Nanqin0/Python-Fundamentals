This repository contains the materials for D-Labâ€™s Python Intermediate workshop series. Basic experience with Python  e.g. through [Python Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Fundamentals-Pilot) is expected.

## Workshop Goals

This interactive workshop series is a follow-up to D-Lab's [Python Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Fundamentals-Pilot). It covers loops and conditionals, more analysis and visualization in Pandas, and a basic data science project workflow.

## Learning Objectives

After completing Python Intermediate, you will be able to:
- Understand and write for-loops.
- Understand and write if-statements.
- Write your own functions.
- Do basic operations in Pandas, including simple visualizations.
- Understand a basic workflow for a data science project.

This workshop does **not** cover the following:
- Navigating Jupyter Notebooks, assigning variables, data types, and error messages. These are covered in [Python Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Fundamentals-Pilot).
- Advanced DataFrame manipulation. This is covered in [Python Data Wrangling](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Data-Wrangling).
- Advanced data visualization. This is covered in [Python Data Visualization](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Data-Visualization).

## Workshop Structure

Python Intermediate has 3 parts. Each of the parts takes 2 hours, and is delivered in a lecture-style coding walkthrough interrupted by challenge problems and a break. Instructors and TAs are dedicated to engaging you in the classroom and answering questions in plain language.

1. **Part 1: Control Flow and Functions**
2. **Part 2: Data Analysis and Visualization**
3. **Part 3: Project**


## Installation Instructions

Before attending the workshop, you should install Python and Jupyter to your computer. If you need help, please submit a [consulting request](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/consulting/submit-consulting-request) with D-Lab prior to the start of the workshop.

Anaconda is software that allows you to run Python and Jupyter notebooks on your computer. Installing Anaconda is the easiest way to make sure you have all the necessary software to run the materials for this workshop. Complete the following steps:

1. [Download and install Anaconda (Python 3.9 distribution)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Click "Download" and then click 64-bit "Graphical Installer" for your current operating system.

2. Download the [Python-Intermediate workshop materials](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Intermediate-Pilot):

* Click the green "Code" button in the top right of the repository information.
* Click "Download Zip".
* Extract this file to a folder on your computer where you can easily access it (we recommend Desktop).

3. Optional: if you're familiar with `git`, you can instead clone this repository by opening a terminal and entering `git clone git@github.com:dlab-berkeley/Python-Intermediate-Pilot.git`.

## Run the code

Now that you have all the required software and materials, you need to run the code:

1. Open the Anaconda Navigator application. You should see the green snake logo appear on your screen. Note that this can take a few minutes to load up the first time.

2. Click the "Launch" button under "Jupyter Lab" and navigate through your file system to the `Python-Intermediate` folder you downloaded above.

3. Navigate to the "lessons" folder.

4. Open the `1_Control_Flow_and_Functions.ipynb` to begin.

5. Press Shift + Enter (or Ctrl + Enter) to run a cell.

## Is Python not working on your laptop?

If you do not have Anaconda installed and the materials loaded on your workshop by the time it starts, we *strongly* recommend using the UC Berkeley Datahub to run the materials for these lessons. You can access the DataHub by clicking this button:

[![Datahub](https://img.shields.io/badge/launch-datahub-blue)](https://dlab.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2FPython-Intermediate-Pilot&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2FPython-Intermediate-Pilot%2F)

The DataHub downloads this repository, along with any necessary packages, and allows you to run the materials in a Jupyter notebook that is stored on UC Berkeley's servers. No installation is necessary from your end - you only need an internet browser and a CalNet ID to log in. By using the DataHub, you can save your work and come back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, just go straight to [DataHub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu), sign in, and you click on the `Python-Intermediate` folder.

If you don't have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can still run these lessons in Binder, which is another cloud-based option. Click this button:

Note: Using Binder, you unfortunately cannot save your work.


# About the UC Berkeley D-Lab

D-Lab works with Berkeley faculty, research staff, and students to advance data-intensive social science and humanities research. Our goal at D-Lab is to provide practical training, staff support, resources, and space to enable you to use R for your own research applications. Our services cater to all skill levels and no programming, statistical, or computer science backgrounds are necessary. We offer these services in the form of workshops, one-to-one consulting, and working groups that cover a variety of research topics, digital tools, and programming languages.  

Visit the [D-Lab homepage](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/) to learn more about us. You can view our [calendar](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/events/calendar) for upcoming events, learn about how to utilize our [consulting](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/consulting) and [data](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/data) services, and check out upcoming [workshops](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/events/workshops).

## After completion

After completing the workshop, you will be easily able to transition to other D-Lab workshops such as [Python Data Wrangling](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Data-Wrangling) or [Python Data Visualization](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Data-Visualization).
