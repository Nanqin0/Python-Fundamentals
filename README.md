This repository contains the materials for D-Labâ€™s Python Fundamentals workshop series. No prior experience with Python is required.

## Workshop Goals

This interactive workshop series is your complete introduction to programming Python for people with little or no previous programming experience. By the end of the series, you will be able to apply your knowledge of basic principles of programming and data manipulation to a real-world social science application.

Python Fundamentals series has 6 parts. Each of the parts takes 2 hours, and is delivered in a lecture-style coding walkthrough interrupted by challenge problems and a break. Instructors and TAs are dedicated to engaging you in the classroom and answering questions in plain language.

Python Fundamentals I is intended for the complete beginner in Python. We will go over the basics of Python in Jupyter, variables and data types, and a gentle introduction to data analysis in Pandas:

1. **Part 1: Introduction to Jupyter and Python**
2. **Part 2: Data Types and Structures**
3. **Part 3: Introduction to Pandas**

Python Fundamentals II introduces functions, loops and conditionals, and more advanced data analysis in Pandas. It contains three two-hour sessions:

4. **Part 1: Control Flow and Functions**
5. **Part 2: Data Analysis and Visualization**
6. **Part 3: Project**

After completing Python Fundamentals, you will be able to navigate Jupyter Notebooks, assign variables, distinguish common data types and structures, apply methods, and do basic operations in Pandas. You will have the minimum requirements to continue to other D-Lab workshops such as [Python Data Wrangling](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Data-Wrangling) or [Python Data Visualization](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Data-Visualization).

After completing Python Intermediate, you will be able to understand for-loops and if-statements, write your own functions, and do more operations in Pandas such as creating simple visualizations. You will be easily able to transition to other D-Lab workshops such as [Python Data Wrangling](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Data-Wrangling) or [Python Data Visualization](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Data-Visualization).


## Installation Instructions

Anaconda is a useful package management software that allows you to run Python and Jupyter notebooks very easily. Installing Anaconda is the easiest way to make sure you have all the necessary software to run the materials for this workshop. Complete the following steps:

1. [Download and install Anaconda (Python 3.9 distribution)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Click "Download" and then click 64-bit "Graphical Installer" for your current operating system.

2. Download the [Python-Fundamentals workshop materials](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Fundamentals):

* Click the green "Code" button in the top right of the repository information.
* Click "Download Zip".
* Extract this file to a folder on your computer where you can easily access it (we recommend Desktop).

3. Optional: if you're familiar with `git`, you can instead clone this repository by opening a terminal and entering `git clone git@github.com:dlab-berkeley/Python-Fundamentals-I.git`.

## Run the code

Now that you have all the required software and materials, you need to run the code:

1. Open the Anaconda Navigator application. You should see the green snake logo appear on your screen. Note that this can take a few minutes to load up the first time. 

2. Click the "Launch" button under "Jupyter Lab" and navigate through your file system to the `Python-Fundamentals` folder you downloaded above.

3. Navigate to lessons -> Fundamentals-I

4. Open the `01_Jupyter_and_Python.ipynb` to begin.

5. Press Shift + Enter (or Ctrl + Enter) to run a cell.

## Is Python not working on your laptop? 

If you do not have Anaconda installed and the materials loaded on your workshop by the time it starts, we *strongly* recommend using the UC Berkeley Datahub to run the materials for these lessons. You can access the DataHub by clicking this button: 

[![Datahub](https://img.shields.io/badge/launch-datahub-blue)](https://dlab.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2FPython-Fundamentals-Revamp&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2FPython-Fundamentals-Revamp%2F)

The DataHub downloads this repository, along with any necessary packages, and allows you to run the materials in a Jupyter notebook that is stored on UC Berkeley's servers. No installation is necessary from your end - you only need an internet browser and a CalNet ID to log in. By using the DataHub, you can save your work and come back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, just go straight to [DataHub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu), sign in, and you click on the `Python-Fundamentals` folder.

If you don't have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can still run these lessons in the cloud, by clicking this button:

By using this button, you cannot save your work unfortunately.
